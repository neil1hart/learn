Git repositories should be setup with 2 files at the start: .gitignore and .gitatrributes.  .gitignore is the more used file, while .gitattributes protects unix and mac users from those on windows.

.gitattributes should be setup at the beginning of the project.  Adding the files later may cause problem updating files that offend the settings.  There is a site that looks at automating this: https://gitattributes.io/.  Docucmentation for this files is: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes

.gitignore can be updated as the project grows but a nice site to get most of the setup is: https://www.gitignore.io.  The original setup was built with https://www.gitignore.io/api/java,gradle,intellij.  Documentatio is: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
